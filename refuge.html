            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>As our assigned client, the City of Vancouver asked our team of three to explore why people in Vancouver do not prepare for emergencies when they know they should. We wanted to avoid a generic solution of presenting yet another resource or event for people when we had evidence that they were unlikely to use them.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Assumptions</h2>
            <p>We began with an assumption to prompt our research—defining “emergencies” as natural disasters, “aware but unprepared” as the recognition of the possibility of a disaster and that basic emergency drill knowledge is insufficient. We hypothesized that due to a majority of  the population lack first-hand experienced in a disaster, residents did not understand the severity of the situation and are therefore unmotivated to prepare.</p>
            

            <h2>Research Summary</h2>
            <p>We consolidated our findings into a Synthesis Wall attempting to tie together what we had learned. We also created a persona for our target audience; journey mapping their day to find possible pain points for intervention. My main contribution to this portion was secondary research and synthesizing ideas.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>At this point, we still lacked direction. We struggled to tie together our research into actionable insights that would help residents prepare for emergencies. Rather than proceeding on half-baked insights, we returned to gathering further research through primary research via interviews.</p>

            <p>With our new findings, we as a team consolidated our research by revisiting our synthesis wall. To assist our struggle for insights and direction, we explored the reasoning behind our findings through an affinity diagram—separating those that were more prepared, versus less prepared as a starting point to reveal the gap between the two groups. But realizing that our project was likely too broad for our sample group and the time we had available, we narrowed the scope of our target group to second generation students—since all our interviewees were from this group and it felt worthwhile to explore. This generation would be growing up, starting to become independent, and begin taking care of their previous generation meaning encouraging their efforts would support long-term changes. </p>

            </div>
            
            <h2>Framing</h2>
            <p>Using our newly generated persona, we found their main challenge to be seeing value in themselves and what they have since they are busy trying to establish their own worth to their parents. This, in conjunction with a previous insight of individuals making decisions based on their emotions and where they place their value, led us to battling self-worth. We found that plenty of resources were available, but a lack in a drive to utilize them.</p>
            
            <div class="analysis-artifacts">
                <a href="#lightbox-persona"><picture>
                    <source media="(max-width:120em)" srcset="img/persona-nathan-50.png">

                </a>
            </div>

            <p>If we can encourage second generation students to see greater worth in themselves, we can mitigate their apathy towards better preparing themselves for emergencies. And with this group encouraged to prepare for emergencies, they can help encourage those around them.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>We posed this question: How might we foster human connections in an emotionally-safe environment, and through that connection, reshape their perception of self-value? Which led us to propose Refuge, a platform for people to anonymously talk about personal topics.</p>

            <p>I created the following on-boarding mock-up after collaborating on a quick sketched wireframe. We settled on a warm and softer colour scheme to facilitate a calmer and safer environment to speak your mind in.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>From this project, I learned the importance of speaking to the people throughout the design process. Their experiences and mindsets are essential to creating something that actually helps your audience. Additionally, they broaden and challenge your own perspective and thoughts, leaving you more open-minded than when the project began.</p>
