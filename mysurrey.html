            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The City of Surrey was our assigned client, seeking to engage youth in an authentic way and on the youths’ terms. Through interviews and case studies of other cities, our team of three found that people valued connections with friends and feeling acknowledged when engaging in activities or with others. These led to individuals forming their identities around a community, and becoming an influencer within it. To encourage this engagement, we proposed the City of Surrey foster local connections through a community network as a part of their online platform.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>Beginning with a set of assumptions regarding how we thought youth and the City of Surrey perceived each other, we began our research with case studies of other cities’ efforts towards positive connections with their residents and spoke to those with adjacent experience. The pandemic lockdown limited the reach of those we could speak to. I supplemented our research with case studies and interviews.</p>
            
            <p>From these, we found people as youth simply wanted meaningful human connections, had the perception of government as an unapproachable entity, and the pattern of exposure to a community at a young age leading to long-term engagement. Since the City of Surrey wants to authentically engage on the youths’ terms, the City of Surrey needed to recognize that people want:</p>

            <div class="insights">
                <h2>Connection</h2>
                <p>Sharing an activity with friends is a significant motivator towards continued commitment to a community group, as people want to feel connected.</p>

                <h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
                <p>The government does not seem approachable because of a lack of back-and-forth. If people were to feel acknowledged, they would be much more inclined to engage.</p>

                <h2>Identity</h2>
                <p>Individuals and communities are mutually dependent in that they both derive their identities from each other.</p>

            <h2>Framing</h2>
            <p>So how might the City of Surrey reinforce local connections as a part of residents’ identities in order to encourage local engagement? In order to have authentic local engagement they need to care about local issues. Local issues become important when their local identity is a significant part of their personal identities. In order to have a local identity they must have local connections. Thus, we aimed to help the City of Surrey foster these local connections.</p>
            
            <p>But given the lockdown, individuals would not be able to connect face-to-face. So we decided to explore the relationship between a physical and digital space, and how this could help individuals identify with the physical location of Surrey through an online platform. From our exploration in existing online platforms, we found people using online groups to unsuccessfully mimic local neighbourhood functionality. Some groups were unable to include everyone, while other platforms were much too broad. This led us to propose MySurrey Bridge, an online chat system—integrated as an addition to their current site—for local neighbourhoods to connect and engage with each other.</p>
            
            <p>This online platform would be integrated into the City of Surrey’s existing site (the site has been updated since then), utilizing their pre-existing back-end for account creation and verification. With the inclusion of access to city officials, we are allowing the City of Surrey’s website to serve its intended purpose of a direct communication channel instead of fully relying on various offshoot social media.</p>

The COVID-19 lockdown made it difficult to find opportunities to speak and test with our target audience and we largely needed to depend on our instincts and experience.</p>
